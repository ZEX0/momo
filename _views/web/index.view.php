      <br />
      For thousands of years Egypt&nbsp;had a complex and stable culture that later  influenced the cultures of Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Covering an area  of about 1,001,450 square kilometres,&nbsp;Egypt&nbsp;is  one of the most populated countries in Africa.&nbsp;The  vast majority of its estimated 78 million people live near the banks of the Nile River,  meaning that approximately 99% of the population uses only about 5.5% of the  total land area. </p>
